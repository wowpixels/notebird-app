The NoteBird App is a note-taking app, a Notion Clone. The app is developed for educational purposes to learn how such a full stack app is developed. I have followed the course on CodeWithAntonio to create the NoteBird app.

The following tech is used within the Next.js framework:

- BlockNotes, the main editor
- Clerk, Auth
- Convex, The Backend
- Emoji Picker React
- ShadCN, UI
- Sonner, Toast Notifications
- TailwindCSS
- usehooks-ts, React hook lib written in TypeScript
- Zod, Schema declaration and validation lib
- Zustand, State Management

**Live:** [NoteBird App](https://notebird.wowpixels.app)

## Quick start

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
npx convex dev
